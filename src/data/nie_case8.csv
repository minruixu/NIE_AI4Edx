🔍 Case Scenario Study: AI Integration in a University Classroom,
,
1. Science – Biology Lab Reports & Feedback Automation,
,
Scenario:,
"Dr. Yeo teaches undergraduate biology. Struggling to keep up with the marking load, she starts using an AI writing assistant (e.g., ChatGPT or SciNote) to provide initial formative feedback on students' weekly lab reports. The tool highlights structural issues, suggests rephrasing, and checks for clarity in hypothesis statements and result interpretations.",
,
Challenge:,
"Students begin to rely too heavily on AI suggestions. Dr. Yeo modifies the workflow: students must submit an ""AI Reflection Log"" where they document what the AI suggested, what they accepted, and why.",
,
Outcome:,
"Students reported learning to critically evaluate AI input. Dr. Yeo was able to provide more targeted human feedback, reducing repetitive commenting. Peer reviews improved as students mimicked AI's feedback language.",

2. Engineering – Prompt Engineering in a Design Module,
,
Scenario:,
"Prof. Lim, teaching an ""AI in Design Thinking"" elective, introduces students to prompt engineering. Teams work on building a prototype ChatGPT-based assistant to simulate responses in a customer support system for smart home devices.",
,
Challenge:,
"Students initially use overly generic prompts and receive inconsistent results. To address this, Prof. Lim runs workshops on refining instructions and testing outputs for accuracy and hallucination detection.",
,
Outcome:,
Students report a deeper understanding of how input affects AI output and begin documenting prompt chains as part of their project submission. One group adapts their chatbot into a Capstone project.,

3. Humanities – Critical Source Analysis with AI Assistance,
,
Scenario:,
"Ms. Tan teaches a course on Historical Methods. She introduces GenAI tools to help students brainstorm research questions and analyze sample primary sources (e.g., 19th-century letters). Students use AI to draft arguments and identify themes, but must compare them against traditional methods.",
,
Challenge:,
Some students overly rely on AI-summarized interpretations without engaging with the text deeply.,
,
Outcome:,
"To reinforce critical thinking, Ms. Tan requires side-by-side comparisons between AI interpretation and their own. A rubric assesses not only argument quality but also AI usage reflection.",

📚 Learning Process Analysis Points,
,
Stage,Explanation
1. Literature Search Selection,"Focus on top-tier, recent studies on GenAI in higher education; include use cases, teacher/student perception studies, and subject-specific implementations."
2. Critical Evaluation of Sources,"Assess reliability (peer-reviewed, empirical evidence), practical relevance, and discussion of risks (bias, hallucinations, overreliance)."
3. Synthesizing Research Insights,"Identify emerging patterns—AI speeds up tasks, but may weaken originality; students need guidance to use it reflectively."
4. Identifying Research Gaps,"Few longitudinal studies on how AI use reshapes deep learning; limited comparative work across disciplines (e.g., STEM vs humanities AI use); scarce data on student-AI reflective practice development."
,
,
❓Three Key Reflective Questions,
,
1. How can AI tools be scaffolded to support—not supplant—critical thinking and academic integrity across disciplines?,
,
"2. What strategies can educators adopt to track and assess meaningful student-AI interaction (e.g., reflective logs, prompt revision logs)?",
,
"3. What role should institutional policy play in guiding responsible and effective AI integration in teaching, learning, and assessment?",
