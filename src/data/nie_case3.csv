Case 1: AI in Engineering – Automating Design Feedback in a CAD Course

Context:
"In an undergraduate mechanical engineering course at a Singaporean university, Dr. Tan uses ChatGPT and Copilot to assist students in iterative design tasks involving CAD software."

Implementation:
"Students upload their design summaries into ChatGPT, which provides preliminary feedback on structural assumptions, materials choice, and compliance with design constraints. Feedback is cross-referenced with actual testing outcomes and peer reviews."

Reflection:
"This use of AI reduces repetitive instructor workload and helps students refine their thinking. However, Dr. Tan notices some students overly trust AI’s engineering advice, prompting him to run workshops on AI’s computational limits and verification protocols."



Case 2: AI in Foreign Language Education – Enhancing Writing Fluency in French

Context:
Madame Liu teaches advanced French writing at a university. She experiments with ChatGPT to boost students’ fluency and coherence in argumentative writing.

Implementation:
"Students draft essays, then input sections into ChatGPT to generate alternate phrasings, idiomatic corrections, or additional arguments. They compare the AI-generated French with their own writing to identify errors and expand vocabulary."

Reflection:
"Students report increased confidence and lexical richness. Still, Madame Liu emphasizes the need for human input, as ChatGPT sometimes misapplies register and cultural nuance, especially in persuasive contexts."



Case 3: AI in Science Education – Supporting Lab Report Analysis in Biology

Context:
"Dr. Soh runs a second-year biology lab module focused on cell culture. To help students analyze data more independently, he integrates ChatGPT into lab report preparation."

Implementation:
"Students paste their experiment data and draft summaries into ChatGPT, asking it to suggest result interpretations, compare with known models, and even propose hypotheses. They then revise based on both AI feedback and rubric criteria."

Reflection:
"While AI assists students with scientific writing and interpretation, Dr. Soh stresses that students must verify AI-provided scientific facts, especially when ChatGPT hallucinates plausible-sounding—but inaccurate—biological mechanisms."

Case Scenario Study 4: Integrating AI in a University Humanities Classroom

Title:
Reimagining Inquiry and Reflection: Using Generative AI in Undergraduate Humanities Education

Context:
"Dr. Lee, a lecturer in the Department of History at a Singaporean university, has been experimenting with generative AI tools like ChatGPT in his inquiry-based modules. Initially skeptical due to AI’s perceived limitations in humanities discourse, he now integrates ChatGPT in three main ways: formulating inquiry questions, assisting with historical analysis, and promoting reflective critique."

Implementation:

Students were asked to use ChatGPT to generate historical inquiry questions based on a provided set of primary sources.

They used AI to draft outlines for essays and compare GPT-generated perspectives with academic literature.

"In peer review, students critically examined AI responses, discussing historical accuracy and narrative bias."

Outcomes:
"Students reported greater engagement, especially in the ideation phase. However, Dr. Lee observed a tendency toward over-reliance on AI interpretations, prompting further instruction on critical interrogation of AI outputs."

Reflection:
This case revealed AI’s potential in augmenting critical thought but emphasized the need for structured guidance to ensure responsible use.



2. Learning Process Analysis Points

Literature Search Selection:
Educators must guide students in selecting scholarly vs. AI-generated content and help them compare AI output with peer-reviewed articles.

Critical Evaluation of Sources:
"Emphasis is placed on evaluating AI responses for factual accuracy, bias, and historical plausibility, especially in disciplines like history or ethics."

Synthesizing Research Insights:
Learners synthesize GPT-generated insights with conventional academic sources to construct nuanced arguments.

Identifying Research Gaps:
"Through AI, students can rapidly prototype research questions, then identify areas where the AI’s knowledge is limited, prompting deeper exploration."



3. Key Questions for Classroom Inquiry

1. How can generative AI support the development of critical thinking skills in humanities education without fostering dependency?

"2. In what ways does AI-generated content differ from scholarly literature in terms of depth, accuracy, and perspective?"

3. How should educators scaffold the responsible use of generative AI to align with ethical academic practices?
