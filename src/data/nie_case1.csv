Case Study Scenario (University Classroom),
,
Title: Responsible Use of ChatGPT in University History Seminars: From Drafting to Critique,
,
Context:,
"Dr. Lim teaches a third-year undergraduate seminar titled Critical Approaches to Historical Inquiry. As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become more widely used, Dr. Lim notices a divide among students—some use AI for idea generation or feedback, while others avoid it due to concerns about plagiarism or its credibility. A few students submit AI-generated content without critical revision, which raises issues of academic honesty and lack of analytical depth.",
,
Teaching Intervention:,
"To address this, Dr. Lim introduces a structured three-phase assignment sequence:",
,
1. Inquiry Question Development via ChatGPT,
"Students are instructed to use ChatGPT to generate 3–5 inquiry-based research questions related to their term paper topics. They then critically assess these questions, identify historical inaccuracies or conceptual weaknesses, and refine them based on scholarly criteria discussed in class.",
,
2. Draft Feedback and Revision Cycle,
"After writing a first draft of their term paper, students use ChatGPT to generate formative feedback (e.g., suggestions on structure, clarity, coherence). They reflect on this feedback, apply selected revisions, and justify their choices in a meta-commentary. AI-generated content is cross-checked with plagiarism software, and students are required to cite or disclose any direct use of AI output.",
,
3. AI Output Critique and Peer Discussion,
"As a final exercise, students critique a ChatGPT-generated historical analysis. In seminar, they compare the AI’s reasoning, use of evidence, and historical perspective with peer submissions. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of historiographical methods and the limitations of LLMs in nuanced historical interpretation.",
,
Outcome:,
Students submit a portfolio including:,
,
Original vs refined inquiry questions,
,
Revised term paper with AI feedback logs,
,
Reflective commentary on AI use,
,
Critique of AI-generated historical analysis,
,
"This case builds students’ skills in ethical tool use, critical engagement, and scholarly writing.",

Learning Process Analysis Points (Improved),
,
Process Step,Enhanced Explanation
Literature Search Selection,"Students are guided to compare AI-generated references with peer-reviewed academic databases (e.g., JSTOR, Scopus), identifying credibility issues and understanding proper academic sourcing."
Critical Evaluation of Sources,"Through comparison of AI outputs with established literature, students learn to evaluate for accuracy, perspective, bias, and scholarly reliability."
Synthesizing Research Insights,Students consolidate insights from both AI outputs and academic literature to construct arguments and build evidence-based narratives.
Identifying Research Gaps,"Students analyze where AI fails to provide depth (e.g., historiographical context, original critique), allowing them to identify areas needing deeper human-led inquiry."

,
Three Key Reflective Questions,
,
"1. In what ways can ChatGPT enhance, rather than replace, your role as a critical thinker and writer in academic work?",
,
"2. What limitations did you observe in ChatGPT’s ability to generate meaningful historical inquiry or conclusions, and how did you address them?",
,
3. How can students responsibly integrate generative AI tools into academic assignments while upholding academic integrity and disciplinary standards?,
