1. Case Scenario Study (University-level)

Subject: Science – Environmental Science

Scenario:
"Dr. Lim, a university lecturer in Environmental Science, introduces ChatGPT into a unit on urban sustainability. Students are asked to input different urban planning policies into ChatGPT to simulate environmental impact assessments. Using AI-generated comparisons, students then validate outputs with real-world data sets from Singapore’s URA and NEA databases."

Learning Impact:
"Students become more critical in evaluating AI outputs, identifying hallucinations, and refining their prompts to produce reliable policy scenarios."



Subject: Engineering – Mechanical Engineering

Scenario:
"Prof. Tan implements AI to support a CAD project. Students design an automated gear system and use ChatGPT to generate initial design rationales, material recommendations, and basic stress analysis parameters. The outputs serve as drafts to be tested and improved through real simulations in SolidWorks."

Learning Impact:
Students accelerate early-stage conceptualization while learning to verify and iterate AI-supported designs with engineering software.



Subject: Humanities – Philosophy

Scenario:
"Dr. Chong’s ethics seminar includes an activity where students use AI to generate opposing arguments on controversial topics like euthanasia or AI rights. Students critique the AI’s logic and compare it against classic ethical frameworks (e.g., Kantianism, Utilitarianism), then revise the arguments accordingly."

Learning Impact:
"Encourages metacognition, deepens argumentation skills, and fosters ethical reflection on the nature of reasoning and bias in both AI and human cognition."



2. Learning Process Analysis Points

"Literature Search & Selection: Students must locate scholarly works on the role of AI in education within their disciplines (e.g., AI in CAD design, AI in argumentation)."

"Critical Evaluation of Sources: Evaluate the credibility, relevance, and limitations of AI-related research, distinguishing between hype and evidence-based outcomes."

Synthesizing Research Insights: Integrate theoretical and empirical findings to inform classroom use of AI tools; identify strengths and gaps.

"Identifying Research Gaps: Recognize underexplored intersections—such as ethics and AI tool design, or AI for formative assessment feedback in STEM labs."



3. Three Key Questions

1. How does AI integration reshape student engagement and autonomy across disciplines?

2. What strategies help students critically assess and refine AI-generated outputs?

3. In what ways can instructors mitigate overreliance and preserve critical human inquiry in AI-supported classrooms?
