Case Scenario 1: Science – Biology Seminar on Climate Change

"Context: In a university-level environmental biology course, Dr. Lim is “still exploring” how AI can be integrated. She wants to improve critical thinking and student engagement."

"AI Use: She uses ChatGPT to generate scientific discussion prompts about climate change, tailored to recent journal articles. Students are asked to verify the AI’s claims by reviewing peer-reviewed literature and presenting their critiques."

"Challenge: Students become reliant on AI-generated summaries, which are sometimes outdated or simplified."

"Outcome: Dr. Lim realizes that AI is useful for ideation, but needs to scaffold student source validation and argument construction. She redesigns the assignment to include an annotated bibliography and peer feedback."



Case Scenario 2: Engineering – Programming for IoT Devices

"Context: Mr. Tan, a computer engineering lecturer, plans to “try using AI to generate Python code.” He introduces an optional AI assistant during practical lab sessions on IoT device programming."

AI Use: Students are allowed to use CoPilot or ChatGPT for code suggestions. They must annotate which parts were AI-generated and explain the logic.

Challenge: Some students submit code they don’t fully understand.

Outcome: Mr. Tan includes AI audit logs and mini oral checks to ensure students can explain their solutions. He concludes that AI can boost productivity but needs to be coupled with metacognitive reflection.



Case Scenario 3: Humanities – Critical Thinking in Historical Analysis

Context: A history lecturer has “no concrete plans yet” but is interested in “adaptive systems” and “AI for flipped classrooms.” She pilots ChatGPT to generate multiple interpretations of historical events.

"AI Use: Students use AI to simulate debates between historical figures (e.g., Churchill vs. Roosevelt). They are required to fact-check and refine these debates."

Challenge: Students tend to accept AI interpretations uncritically.

Outcome: The instructor adds pre-debate readings and source analysis tasks to ensure deeper engagement and critical evaluation.



Learning Process Analysis Points

"1. Literature Search Selection: Instructors identify reputable sources (e.g., JSTOR, ScienceDirect) to contrast against AI output."

"2. Critical Evaluation of Sources: Students learn to assess bias, credibility, and relevance in both AI-generated and human-curated content."

"3. Synthesizing Research Insights: Learners merge AI suggestions with academic theory to create original, supported arguments."

"4. Identifying Research Gaps: AI tools are used to brainstorm unexplored angles, which students then refine through database searches and consultations."



Three Key Reflective Questions

1. How can we guide students to balance AI support with independent critical thinking?

2. What scaffolds can ensure students understand and validate AI-generated outputs?

3. In what ways can we assess AI-integrated assignments without promoting over-reliance?
