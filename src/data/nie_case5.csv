"Case 1: Dr. Tan Wei Ling (Chinese) – Science Lecturer, NUS"

Scenario: “The Mirage of Accuracy”
"Dr. Tan notices her first-year biology students citing AI-generated climate statistics in lab reports without referencing actual field data. One student claimed, “ChatGPT already summarized the findings,” overlooking the need for peer-reviewed validation. Concerned, she realizes students assume AI outputs equal truth."

Instructor's Response:
"She mandates all students to attach source verification for any AI-generated content and introduces a module on “Scientific Misinformation in the AI Age.” Students must cross-check AI responses against government and academic databases (e.g., NEA, PUB, Scopus)."

Reflection:
"She worries that “science without skepticism is no science at all,” and believes instructors must explicitly teach discernment and data literacy alongside content knowledge."



"Case 2: Dr. Siti Rahmah (Malay) – Engineering Senior Lecturer, SIT"

Scenario: “Push Button Learning”
"During a robotics assignment, Dr. Siti finds several student submissions identical—clean, efficient Python code clearly generated by GenAI. When questioned, students defend their approach, saying, “AI is just like using a calculator.” Dr. Siti is troubled by their lack of debugging ability and problem-framing skills."

Instructor's Response:
"She redesigns the project: instead of only submitting final code, students must now document each trial-and-error step, decision-making process, and prompts used. She also introduces reflective journals on their learning journeys."

Reflection:
"“To be an engineer is not just to build—it is to think systematically under uncertainty,” she shares in a faculty workshop. “AI is a tool, but learning is a process we must preserve.”"



"Case 3: Prof. Arjun Menon (Indian) – Humanities Professor, NTU"

Scenario: “The Death of the Student Voice”
"Prof. Menon reads several polished essays on post-colonial identity but finds them oddly neutral and formulaic. In office hours, one student confesses using ChatGPT: “It sounded better than I could write.” He realizes many students feel their own voices are inferior to AI's fluency."

Instructor's Response:
Prof. Menon implements oral defenses and live in-class essay writing. He also starts each term with a workshop titled: “Your Voice Matters: Critical Thinking and Authorship in the Age of AI.”

Reflection:
He emphasizes that “Education is not content transmission; it’s intellectual awakening. And that cannot be outsourced.”



🔍 Learning Process Analysis

Literature Search Selection: All three instructors integrate AI-verification tasks and library-supported research training.

"Critical Evaluation: They emphasize comparing GenAI outputs with scholarly texts, checking for bias, recency, and credibility."

"Synthesis & Reflection: Instructors require students to write about how and why they used AI, highlighting the reasoning behind using or rejecting AI-generated input."

"Identifying Gaps: Students are taught to recognize what AI tools can't do—emotional nuance, local context, ethical reflection—and build from there."



❓ Three Key Questions for Educators

"1. How can instructors across disciplines explicitly teach students to verify, critique, and reflect on AI usage in academic work?"

2. What role should cultural and disciplinary context play when designing AI-integrated assessments in Singapore's multiracial universities?

"3. How can instructors preserve students’ voice, creativity, and critical thinking in an age of seamless AI fluency?"
